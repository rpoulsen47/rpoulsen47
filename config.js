   This is the ONE file you need to edit to make the site yours.
   Every page on the site reads from here. Change something
   here, and it updates on the homepage, the projects page,
   the about page, and the contact page all at once.

   Rules of thumb:
   - Keep the quote marks around each value
   - Keep the commas at the end of each line
   - Don't delete the curly braces { } or square brackets [ ]

  longBio: `I am a senior at the University of Richmond studying Geography
            and Data Science. My work focuses on using open spatial data
            to answer questions that communities are actually asking.

            In 2024 I interned with the City of Richmond's Office of
            Sustainability, where I built a series of tree-equity
            dashboards now used by neighborhood groups to advocate for
            plantings on underserved blocks. I have also worked on a
            statistical analysis of margins of error in American
            Community Survey data, a project I am co-authoring with
            two faculty members at UR.

            Outside of GIS, I write a small newsletter about urban
            history in the upper South, and I am slowly teaching
            myself to make decent sourdough.

            I am graduating in May 2026 and am looking for full-time
            roles in spatial analysis, planning support, or applied
            research.`,
